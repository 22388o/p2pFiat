# LNFiat
LNFiat aims to build trustless fiatcoins over the Lightning Network. 

Ultimate decentralisation would envision a fully decentralised exchange on which people can take derivative positions. Potentially a p2p protocol such as Holepunch could help here or (with the risk of swearing in church) a type of lightning network gossip. Any wallet would offer fiatcoin conversion and on the other hand the ability to take leveraged long bitcoin positions. Through a p2p protocol (such as Holepunch or lightning network gossip), someone looking to buy bitcoin backed fiatcoin, would issue an offer to sell a short swap. Others, or liquidity providers, for example LN Markets, would make make bids to lock in bitcoin at a certain fiat price.
